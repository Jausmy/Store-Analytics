# Store Analytics Dashboard
## Overview
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of store sales and transaction data, focusing on identifying key revenue trends, understanding product category performance, and evaluating individual store performance. By examining sales patterns over time, across different product categories, and at the store level, we aim to provide actionable insights to optimize sales strategies, improve store operations, and drive overall business growth.

## Executive Summary
This analysis was conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of store sales and transaction data. By examining key metrics such as total revenue, transaction count, average transaction value, and product category performance, we identified key trends and opportunities for improvement. A key insight from the analysis is that annual revenue experienced significant growth in 2021 compared to 2020, but slightly declined in 2022 (see Revenue Summary Dashboard Values). Based on the analysis, we recommend investigating the factors that contributed to the decline in 2022 and developing targeted strategies to revitalize sales growth. This could involve reviewing pricing strategies, enhancing marketing efforts, or optimizing product offerings to better align with customer demand. By implementing these recommendations, the company can potentially reverse the declining trend and achieve sustainable revenue growth (see Potential Impact of Recommendations).

## Task/Objective
The objective of this analysis is to gain a comprehensive understanding of store sales and transaction patterns to identify key trends, evaluate performance, and provide data-driven insights for strategic decision-making. This involves:
-	Data Exploration: Exploring the raw data to understand its structure, identify key variables, and assess data quality.
-	Trend Analysis: Analyzing sales trends over time at different granularities (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually) to identify patterns, seasonality, and areas for potential improvement.
-	Comparative Analysis: Comparing sales performance across different product categories and individual stores to identify top performers, underperforming areas, and potential opportunities for optimization.
-	Performance Evaluation: Evaluating individual store performance based on key metrics such as total revenue, transaction count, and average transaction value to identify areas of strength and weakness.
-	Data Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to effectively communicate the key findings and insights from the analysis.

## Methodology
### Data Sources
The primary data source for this analysis is a sales dataset comprising two tables:
-	Sales by date and product category: Contains information on total sales, distinct transaction count, total items sold, and transaction date for each product category.
-	Store transaction data: Contains information on store number, store name, state abbreviation, total items sold, total transactions, total revenue, and transaction date for each store.

### Tools Used
The following tools were used for data analysis and visualization:
-	Microsoft Excel – Data exploration
-	Tableau – Data visualization and analysis

### Data Exploration
Initial data exploration involved familiarizing ourselves with the dataset and identifying key variables. This included examining the distribution of sales across different product categories, time periods, and stores, as well as identifying potential correlations between transaction count and revenue.

### Data Analysis Techniques
The following data analysis techniques were employed:
-	Trend Analysis: We analyzed sales trends over time at various granularities (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually) to identify patterns, seasonality, and areas for potential improvement. This involved aggregating sales data by different time periods and visualizing the trends to identify any significant fluctuations or consistent patterns in sales performance.
-	Comparative Analysis: We compared sales performance across different product categories and individual stores to identify top performers, underperforming areas, and potential opportunities for optimization. This involved grouping data by product category and store and calculating relevant metrics such as total revenue, transaction count, and average transaction value.
-	Performance Evaluation: We evaluated individual store performance based on key metrics such as total revenue, transaction count, and average transaction value to identify areas of strength and weakness. This involved comparing store performance against overall averages and identifying outliers or stores with significant deviations from the norm.
-	Diagnostic Analysis: This analysis was used to identify the root cause of the year-over-year decline in revenue observed in 2022. By examining various factors such as changes in consumer behavior, economic conditions, or competitor actions, we aimed to understand the underlying reasons for this decline.

## Future Considerations for Data Analysis
In the future, we can leverage additional data analysis techniques to further refine our understanding of sales patterns and optimize sales strategies. These techniques include:
-	Customer Segmentation: This technique can be used to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or other relevant characteristics. By understanding the unique needs and preferences of different customer segments, we can tailor marketing campaigns, personalize product recommendations, and improve customer satisfaction.
-	Predictive Modeling: This technique can be used to forecast future sales, predict demand for specific products, and optimize inventory management. By building statistical models based on historical sales data and relevant factors, we can anticipate future trends and make proactive decisions to improve sales performance.
-	Geospatial Analysis: This method involves analyzing data with geographic components to understand the spatial distribution of sales and identify potential factors that influence store performance. By mapping sales data and overlaying data on factors such as population density, competitor locations, and demographic characteristics, we can identify areas with high or low sales performance and develop targeted strategies.
